# KIKO (Knock In Knock Out): Scaling Causal Inference in Additive Noise Models

Link to the paper: soon

Required packages:
* tensorflow
* numpy
* sklearn
* scipy
* joblib

In order to use KIKO for causal discovery on simulated data execute kiko.py with the desired option (number of variable and number of observations).
```shell
python kiko.py 4 500
```

In order use KIKO on the benchmark datasets use benchmark_causality_pairs.py
